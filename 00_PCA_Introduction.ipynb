        "Imagine you have a dataset with four dimensions (4-D). Since humans can only visualize up to three dimensions, plotting such data directly is impossible. However, by reducing the dimensionality (e.g., from 4D to 2D), we can project the data into a lower-dimensional space and visualize it more easily.\n",
